      Il Campo Moretti - - Art Shane, April 1997

      Strange things are seen by the River Green
      Just below the Vermont line.
      Hear the frogs the wailing dogs
      The McCullough chainsaw whine.
      In pines so tall whose needles fall
      On a shelter cool and damp.
      With hearthstone lain by Donald Swain,
      Known to kin as Camp.

      The sun's past noon, we're eating soon,
      P. and L. may be coming late.
      As Peter plucks those burger pucks
      From the ancient charcoal grate.
      That slaw looks nice with green pepper slice
      There's a loaf of high tech bake.
      Then the fun seeing ice cream run
      Off just-iced birthday cake.

      Let's make the day, give John his say
      On any given topic.
      A point of view that's park askew,
      The other part myopic.
      A lesson on loam, the Pope in Rome
      Whether Henry's acting girly.
      Remind us then, the last wise men
      Were Larry, Moe and Curly.

      I must remind that beds you'll find
      Were made in yesteryear.
      Their names announce like rodeo mounts
      And should inspire fear.
      There's "Rattler" rack, "Sidewinder" sack
      "The Montague Backbreaker".
      Come try a night on "Dynamite"
      Or the dreaded "Widowmaker".

      There'll be no moving or much improving
      To Michael that's distractin'.
      Would cause a fit to Fran and Whit
      Those cornerstones of Acton.
      Just never let your heart forget,
      Amid the champagne and confetti,
      That homestead hidin' on the edge of Leyden
      The soul of the Moretti.
    VERSE
